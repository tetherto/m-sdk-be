# Governance

This document describes how the MiningSDK project is governed and how decisions are made.

MiningSDK is an open-source project. While the code is publicly available and community contributions are welcome, final decision-making authority rests with the MiningSDK core team.

Contributors do not have merge access.

Maintainers are responsible for reviewing pull requests, maintaining code quality, and ensuring alignment with the project roadmap.

Maintainers may be appointed by the Lead Maintainer.
